# Jabez.org Source Code

This repo contains the convoluted source code of the greatest website on Earth.
Seriously tho, it's pretty messy.
/js/dots.js - contains a pretty cool algo for maintaining a game of life inspired by agar.io. 

/old contains a copy of the original, poorly bootstrapped jabez.org
/future used to contain new stuff until i realized i should use github branches
/beta contains an experiment in WebGL
/guernica contains a pretty awesome slide template for a school project (zimilar to slides.js)
/test contains a simple html page that tests if internet is working

That's about it. A major redesign could be coming in the summer of 2016.
