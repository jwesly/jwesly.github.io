The sea rises with mighty roar
And strives to break the barren shore
Till it breaks and resists nevermore
So commencing a frightful squall
To meet and conquer a stubborn wall
As rock and sand crumble and fall-
To dust and to the depths

But still the land in defiance stands
As the waves defeat walls to meet more sands
More plains, more forests, more mountains
Stand resistant to the sea
As the riptide subsides to ripples
And the heart of the storm seems to fade

On the surface, warning buoys merely bob
But the sea's heartbeat still beats the throb
