<poem>
Old Man sees a mighty throng
Of songbirds, going where they belong
In passing, singing the warning song
The warning song of Winter

Old Man tastes the frosty air
As Master Jack rises from his lair
To cover the land in his frigid glare
The frigid glare of Winter

Old Man faces the Northern Plains
Resists the wind, but all in vain
Head bowing against the icy rain
The icy rain of Winter

Old Man stands on Northern Shore
As sun sets to rise nevermore
As the sea screamed its arctic roar
The frigid Roar of Winter

Old Man stands on Mountain face
The finish of his final race
His prize? Merely a cold embrace
The cold embrace of Winter
