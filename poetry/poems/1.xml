<poem>
I have learned to speak with silence
Made solitude a cherished friend
I have built up walls around me
That none can begin to comprehend

In my greatest flights of fancy
I travel to realms yet unknown
The leader has his contemporaries
But the dreamer dreams alone

I can see beyond the madness
To time's constant ebb and flow
No matter how far our journey
To one destination we all must go

In my greatest flights of fancy
I can see what can't be shown
The voyager has his contemporaries
But the dreamer dreams alone

I have none to call my equal
None to share my inner thoughts
Others may pour their hearts out
But I shall keep mine in my box

In my greatest flights of fancy
Heaven and Hell alike I've known
The thinker has his contemporaries
But the dreamer dreams alone

I shall prepare to resist my demons
To stand against them and risk the fall
For someone needs to stop the madness
Stop the madness for us all

In my greatest flights of fancy
I shall make my secrets known
But the dreamer has no contemporaries
The dreamer must dream alone
